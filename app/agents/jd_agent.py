        Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object that strictly matches this schema:

          (e.g., "3+ years in software development" instead of just "3+ years").
        - "education_required" must also keep the full description, not just the degree name.
        - "responsibilities" and "skills" must preserve all details as provided.
        If information is missing, set the value to null.
        Do not add explanations, extra text, or commentary.
        The response MUST be valid JSON, nothing else."""
